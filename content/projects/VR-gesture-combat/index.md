The goal of this project was to explore game development for VR platforms and to understand how VR differs from traditional input methods. We focused on the control interfaces available in VR, creating natural, gesture-based combat controls that took advantage of VR’s capabilities. We developed a combat system featuring three different abilities, each activated by a gesture derived from the physical action of the ability. A level was also created with a practice target to demonstrate the system. My contributions included implementing the gesture recognition logic, player input system, and VR configuration.
